## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Framer Motion] (https://www.framer.com/motion/) - React animation library

### What I Learned

Throughout the project, I have learned many valuable lessons and also learned new knowledge. Through tweaking the styling of the components, I discovered a new technique that makes the site responsive easier. Furthermore, I also learned React and Framer Motion, as this is my first actual Frontend Mentor project I do it with. There were many struggles trying to animate each component smoothly, but eventually through trial and error, I was able to create animations that I am comfortable with.

### Continued Development

In the future, I would love to continue using React and Framer Motion if possible and also try to use Bootstrap or Styled Components.
